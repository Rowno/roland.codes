My custom terminal config, aliases and functions.

Originally based off [mathiasbynens’ dotfiles][mathiasbynens] which I’ve heavily customised to suit my needs. I built it to organise my dev environment and quickly/easily set up new computers and sync it between computers (work and personal). Also built it to make me more productive with lots of handy little tools and shortcuts.
