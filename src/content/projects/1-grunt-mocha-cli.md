A Grunt plugin for running server-side Mocha tests.

Built the entire plugin. I created it because all other Mocha plugins used Mocha’s Node API, which don’t support all of Mocha’s command line options or allow Node flags to be set.

~1000 downloads a day, included in the [Kraken.js Yeoman generator][kraken].
