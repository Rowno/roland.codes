Most programmers know what a <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr> type (or Media Type) is. It's the two-part identifier used by programs to determine the format of a file or data. In web development, MIME types are most commonly seen in HTTP requests as the value of the `Content-Type` header. But what do the two different parts mean and what are their valid values?

The first part of a MIME type is called the top-level media type and it specifies the general type of the data. The top-level media type can be one of the 7 standard defined types, which consist of:

- _text_ - textual information.
- _image_ - image data.
- _audio_ - audio data.
- _video_ - video data.
- _application_ - some other kind of data, typically either uninterpreted binary
  data or information to be processed by an application.
- _multipart_ - data consisting of multiple entities of independent data types.
- _message_ - an encapsulated message.

The second part is called the sub-type and it specifies the specific format of the data. There are thousands of registered sub-types, far too many to list here. However there's a [list of registered MIME types][list] on the <abbr title="Internet Assigned Numbers Authority">IANA</abbr> website.

The sub-type can also have one of the following optional prefixes to give it special meaning:

- `x-` - Unregistered or experimental. Example: `image/x-icon`
- `vnd.` - Vendor-specific. Example: `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint`
- `prs.` - Personal or vanity. Example: `application/prs.roland`

For more information, see the MIME type [standard][] and [registration][] documents.
