title: Node Boilerplate
commentsIssueId: 10

I've been doing a fair bit of Node.js development lately, and I found that I was repeating the same steps at the start of every new project. So I created a boilerplate. And that boilerplate is https://github.com/Rowno/node-boilerplate.

It encompasses what I think are the generic best practices for all Node.js projects. Which includes things like package.json, folder structure, Git files and more.

As always, pull requests are welcome. :)
