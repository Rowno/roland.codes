# roland.codes

This is the source code of my personal website/blog, which is a static website generated using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Build

### Setup

- Install [Node.js 12](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`

### Tasks

Available tasks:

- `yarn dev` - starts the website in development mode with automatic rebuilding and reloading.
- `yarn build` - performs a production build of the website.
- `yarn start` - starts a simple server for loading the production build locally (requires `yarn build` to be run first).
- `yarn analyze` - visualises the size of the Webpack JavaScript bundles.
- `yarn test` - performs type checking and linting of the code.
- `yarn lint` - just lints the code.

## License

This repository isn't licensed because I want my personal website/brand to be unique. However feel free to play around with the code and learn from it.

And of course pull requests are always welcome. :sparkling_heart:
